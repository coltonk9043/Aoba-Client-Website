# Reach

```
Default Keybind: NONE
Category: COMBAT
```

Adjusts the distance that a player can reach.

This is a common thing that anti-cheats check! If you plan on playing on a server with an anti-cheat (MOST PVP SERVERS),
please ensure that your reach values are reasonable enough to not be detected or DO NOT USE REACH.
