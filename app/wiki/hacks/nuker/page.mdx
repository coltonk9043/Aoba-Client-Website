Nuker destroys all blocks within a certain radius of the player.

There are 2 modes:
1. Creative Mode:
    - Completely obliterates all blocks around the player.
    - Easily detected by AntiCheats as it sends a mass number of packets all at once.

2. Survival Mode:
    - Destroys each block one by one.
    - Not easily detected by Anti-Cheats (This does not include anticheats that check for rotation! Please be sure to use the correct rotation mode for the server you are on!)
