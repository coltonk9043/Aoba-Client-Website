AutoSign can be used to place multiple signs with the same text. 

To set the text used by AutoSign, place down the first sign and type in some text.

Once you finish the sign, Aoba will automatically detect the text of the placed sign and repeat it for every other sign placed.
To reset the text, simply disable and re-enable the module. Doing so will prompt you to place a new sign and restart the process.
