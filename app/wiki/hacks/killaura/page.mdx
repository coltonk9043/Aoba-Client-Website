This module will automatically swing at any player, or mob, that gets within a certain radius of the player. 
This module is also referred to as ```Forcefield``` in other mods.

For servers with heavy anticheats, Aoba provides several options to try an imitate player movement during combat.
It is **HIGHLY** recommended to join an anti-cheat test server to **TUNE** the client for the specific server you
want to play on; simply joining a server and turning it on **WILL** get you banned.
