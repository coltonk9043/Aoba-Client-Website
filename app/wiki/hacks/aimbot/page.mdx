Aimbot is a module that automatically looks towards the nearest entity and locks your crosshair to them.
It can be useful in situations where you must be constantly looking at a player, such as KitPvP.

# Settings
 - Target Entities (Toggle): Whether or not to look at mobs.
 - Target Players (Toggle): Whether or not to look at players.
 - Frequency (Variable): The frequency at which Aoba will scan for a new entity to look at. (Decreasing time between scans decreases performance, but allows for snappier aimbot)
