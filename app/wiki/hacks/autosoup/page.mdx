# AutoSoup
*Default Keybind: NONE*

*Category: COMBAT*

AutoSoup is used to automatically switch to Mushroom Soup and eat it when your health is below a minimum threshold.

This module was built and is meant for KitPvP, as drinking Mushroom Soup usually gives you instant health. This module will NOT work in Vanilla.

# Settings
 - Health (Variable): The minimum health that the AutoSoup will trigger.
