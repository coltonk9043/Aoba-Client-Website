# Breadcrumbs

```
Default Keybind: NONE
Category: RENDER
```

Leaves a trail behind where you walk. Often used to keep track of caves, keep track of bases, or just to show the direction the player 
has walked. 

Re-toggling this module will clear any previous breadcrumbs, and begin from where the player is currently standing.
