# AutoTotem
*Default Keybind: NONE*

*Category: COMBAT*

AutoTotem automatically places a Totem of Undying in your hand as soon as your health falls below a certain threshold or a End Crystal is placed near your player.

Assuming you have infinite number of Totems of Undying, you WILL NOT die. This is especially useful for Hardcore or Anarchy servers, where a death can be detrimental 

# Settings
 - Health (Variable): The health at which the Totem of Undying will be placed into your hand.
 - Main Hand (Toggle): Whether or not the Totem of Undying will be placed in your hand or not.
 - Crystal Radius (Variable): The radius in which Aoba will detect the placement of End Crystals and try to pull out a Totem of Undying.
